Itâ€™s hard to believe but after months of dreaming and planning we have finally landed. We now feel a mixture of emotions;
excited to see what will happen. Everyone here is in good spirits!, that's how we're looking right now. 

![First look](https://blog.roughbook.xyz/public/images/first-look.png){:class="img-responsive"}
                                                                                       
### Goal

Our goal is to transform less-interesting surveys into intuitive environments and old-school styled analysis to
AI-powered inferences. We promise to change not only surveys explorations industries but also User experience.
Surveys will become intuitive and analysis will become conclusive.


### Promise

Capture honest and concrete sentiments at all times. Build incredible explorations on a twinkle (Or We'll do that) and
predict the real, momentous inferences from the community.
